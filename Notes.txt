This project builds semantic search for swim workouts using OpenAI embeddings stored in SQL Server.

I'll run python python_regenerate_embeddings_openai.py
This script regenerates embeddings for all workouts and writes them into SQL Server.

Here are the workouts with embeddings stored as VARBINARY.

I'll run python semantic_search.py to demo results
